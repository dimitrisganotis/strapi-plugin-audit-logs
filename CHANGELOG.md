2. **Update Plugin**: Install v2.0.0: `npm install strapi-plugin-audit-logs@^2.0.0`
3. **Review Configuration**: Update your `config/plugins.js`:
   - Remove `content-type.*` events from tracking if present
   - Review deletion configuration structure
   - Add new event types if desired (`media.update`, `role.*`, `admin.auth.failure`)
4. **Restart Application**: Restart Strapi to apply changes
5. **Set Permissions**: Configure user permissions in admin panel
6. **Data Migration**: Existing audit logs will continue to work - no data migration required
